# Dotobot v4
Created by Maurits Kienhuis, Bram Kreulen, and Julia van der Kris

## Description
Dotobot is a personal project of a group of friends, who saw Discord and thought: not enough bloat. It introduces several functions to a Discord server, including, but not limited to:

- Democratic tempbans and server mutes+
- A searchable, extendable quote database
- Steam integration to quickly ping users whose libraries meet specific criteria
- A lot of easter eggs ;)

This bot is built upon [Pycord](www.pycord.dev).
